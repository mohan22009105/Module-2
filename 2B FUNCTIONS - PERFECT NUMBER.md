## FUNCTIONS - sum of series

### AIM  
To write a Python program to find the sum of series: 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + â€¦.. + 1/N using function .Get the input for the value of n..



### ALGORITHM

1. Start the program.

2. Define a function sum_series(n) that:

   Initializes sum to 0.

   Uses a loop from 1 to n:

   Add 1/i to the sum at each step.

3. Prompt the user to input a value for n.

4. Call the function and store the result.

5. Print the sum rounded to two decimal places.

6. End the program.

        sum1=sum1+(1/i)
    print("The sum of series is",round(sum1,2))

number=int(input())
series(number)
