# Exp. No: 2a  
## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“  print the sum of N even numbers

###  Aim
To Write a Python program to print the sum of N even numbers.

---

###  Algorithm

1. Start the program.

2. Prompt the user to input a number n.

3. Initialize a variable sum to 0.

4. Use a loop from 1 to n:

   In each iteration, check if the number is even (number % 2 == 0).

   If even, add it to the sum.

5. Display the total sum of even numbers.

6. End the program.
